- Deliverable 1: Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis(README.md)

## Summary

From the analysis of the temperatures in June and December we can recommend that Oahu has a pretty decent weather all year around and in regards the temperatures people are able to surf and enjoy ice cream, whenever they travel to Oahu. However there can be other factors which we should analysis and consider additionally to avoid negative surprises. 

Additional queries could be how long it's cold and warm during the days. Wether it's only colder at night and still warm during the days or there a days/ weeks which cold weather all day long. 

Also important is to look more in detail at the rain per rain day in the certain months to figure out whether there is a rain season.
